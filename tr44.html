    <p><i><b>Note:</b> the information in 
    this annex is not intended as an exhaustive description of the use and 
    interpretation of Unicode character properties and behavior. It must be used in conjunction with 
    the data in the other files in the Unicode Character Database, and relies on the notation and 
    definitions supplied in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html">The Unicode 
    Standard</a>. All chapter references are to Version 
    6.0.0 of the standard unless otherwise 
    indicated.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>1 <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
  
  <p>The Unicode Standard is far more than a simple encoding of characters.
  The standard also associates a rich set of semantics with each encoded
  character&#x2014;properties that
  are required for interoperability and correct behavior in
  implementations, as well as for Unicode conformance. 
  These semantics are cataloged in the Unicode Character Database (UCD), a collection of data files 
  which contain the Unicode character code points and character names. 
  The data files define the Unicode character properties and mappings between 
  Unicode characters (such as case mappings).</p>
  
  <p>This annex describes the UCD and provides a guide to the various 
  documentation files associated with it. Additional information
  about character properties and their use is contained in the
  Unicode Standard and its annexes. In particular, implementers should familiarize themselves
  with the formal definitions and conformance requirements for properties detailed
  in <i>Section 3.5, Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
  and with the material in <i>Chapter 4, Character Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  
  <p>The latest version of the UCD is always located on the Unicode 
  Web site at:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/">http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/</a>

  <p>The specific files for the UCD associated with this version of 
  the Unicode Standard (6.0.0) are located at:</p>

 <h2>2 <a name="Conformance">Conformance</a></h2>
 
 <p>The Unicode Character Database is an integral part of the Unicode Standard.</p>
 
<p>The UCD contains normative property and mapping information required for 
implementation of various Unicode algorithms such as the Unicode Bidirectional 
Algorithm, Unicode Normalization, and Unicode Casefolding. The data files also 
contain additional informative and provisional character property information.</p>

<p>Each specification of a Unicode algorithm, whether specified in the text of 
[<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] or in one of the Unicode 
Standard Annexes, designates which data file(s) in the UCD are needed to 
provide normative property information required by that algorithm.</p>

<p>For information on the meaning and application of the terms, 
<i>normative</i>, <i>informative</i>, and <i>provisional</i>, see <i>Section 3.5, 
Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>

<p>For information about the applicable terms of use for the
UCD, see the Unicode <a href="http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<h3>2.1 <a name="Simple_Derived">Simple and Derived Properties</a></h3>

<p>Some character properties in the UCD are simple properties.
This status has no bearing on whether or not the properties are
normative, but merely indicates that their values
are not derived from some combination of other properties.</p>

<p>Other character properties are derived. This means that
their values are derived by rule from some other
combination of properties. Generally such rules are
stated as set operations, and may or may not include
explicit exception lists for individual characters.</p>

<p>Certain simple properties are defined merely
to make the statement of the rule defining a derived
property more compact or general. Such properties are
known as <a href="#Contributory_Properties">contributory properties</a>.
Sometimes these contributory properties are defined to
encapsulate the messiness inherent in exception
lists. At other times, a contributory property may
be defined to help stabilize the definition of
an important derived property which is subject to stability
guarantees.</p>

<p>Derived character properties are not considered
second-class citizens among Unicode character properties.
They are defined to make implementation of important
algorithms easier to state. Included among the
first-class derived properties important for such
implementations are: Uppercase, Lowercase, XID_Start,
XID_Continue, Math, and Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, all
defined in DerivedCoreProperties.txt, as well as derived
properties for the optimization of normalization, defined
in DerivedNormalizationProps.txt.</p>

<p>Implementations should simply use the derived properties,
and should not try to rederive them from lists of simple
properties and collections of rules, because of the
chances for error and divergence when doing so.</p>

<p>Definitions of property derivations are provided
for information only, typically in comment fields
in the data files. Such definitions may be refactored,
refined, or corrected over time.</p>

<p>If there are any cases of mismatches
between the definition of a derived property as
listed in DerivedCoreProperties.txt or similar data
files in the UCD, and the definition of a derived
property as a set definition rule, the explicit
listing in the data file should <i>always</i> be taken
as the normative definition of the property. As described
in <a href="#Release_Stability">Stability of Releases</a> the property
listing in the data files for any given version
of the standard  will never change for that version.</p>

<h3>2.2 <a name="Use_Default">Use of Default Values</a></h3>

<p>Unicode character properties have default values. Default
values are the value or values that a character property takes
for an unassigned code point, or in some instances, for
designated subranges of code points, whether assigned or
unassigned. For example, the default value of a binary
Unicode character property is always "N".</p>

<p>For the formal discussion of default values, see D26 in
<i>Section 3.5, Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].
For conventions related to default values in various data files
of the UCD and for documentation regarding the particular default values of
individual Unicode character properties, see <a href="#Default_Values">Default Values</a>.</p>

<h3>2.3 <a name="Release_Stability">Stability of Releases</a></h3>

<p>Just as for the Unicode Standard as a whole, each version of the
UCD, once published, is absolutely stable and will <i>never</i>
change. Each released version is archived in a directory on
the Unicode Web site, with a directory number associated with
that version. URLs pointing to that version's directory are also
stable and will be maintained in perpetuity.</p>

<p>Any errors discovered for a released version of the UCD
are noted in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Errata">Errata</a>],
and if appropriate will be corrected in a <i>subsequent</i>
version of the UCD.</p>

<p>Stability guarantees constraining how Unicode character
properties can (or cannot) change between releases of the UCD
are documented in the Unicode Consortium Stability
Policies [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Stability">Stability</a>].</p>

<h4>2.3.1 <a name="Allowed_Changes">Changes to Properties Between Releases</a></h4>

<p>Updates to character properties in the Unicode Character Database may be required
for any of three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>To cover new characters added to the standard</li>
<li>To add new character properties to the standard</li>
<li>To change the assigned values for a property for some characters already in the standard</li>
</ol>

<p>While the Unicode Consortium endeavors to keep the values of all
character properties as stable as possible between versions, occasionally circumstances
may arise which require changing them. In particular, as less well-documented scripts, such
as those for minority languages, or historic scripts are added to the standard, the exact
character properties and behavior may not fully be known when the script is first encoded.
The properties for some of these characters may change as further information becomes
available or as implementations turn up problems in the initial property assignments.
As far as possible, any readjustment of property values based
on growing implementation experience is made to be compatible with established practice.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a character property value is changed to prevent incorrect generalizations
about a character's use based on its nominal property values. For example, U+200B ZERO
WIDTH SPACE was originally classified as a space character (General_Category=Zs), but
it was reclassified as a Format character (General_Category=Cf) to clearly distinguish it from space characters
in its function as a format control for line breaking.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that a particular value for an enumerated
property will actually have characters associated with it. Also, because of
changes in property value assignments between versions of the standard, a
property value that once had characters associated with it may later have none.
Such conditions and changes are rare, but implementations must not
assume that all property values are associated with non-null
sets of characters. For example, currently the special Script property
value Katakana_Or_Hiragana has no characters associated with it.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 <a name="Obsolete_Properties">Obsolete Properties</a></h4>

<p>In some instances an entire property may become <i>obsolete</i>.
For example, the <a href="#ISO_Comment">ISO_Comment</a> property was once used to keep
track of annotations for characters used in the production of name lists for
ISO/IEC 10646 code charts. As of Unicode 5.2.0 that property became obsolete, 
and its value is now defaulted to the null string for all Unicode code points.</p>

<p>An obsolete property is never removed from the UCD.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 <a name="Deprecated_Properties">Deprecated Properties</a></h4>

<p>Occasionally an obsolete property may also be formally
<i>deprecated</i>. This is an indication that the property is no longer recommended for
use, perhaps because its original intent has been replaced by another property
or because its specification was somehow defective. See also the
general discussion of <a href="#Deprecation">Deprecation</a>.</p>

<p>A deprecated property is never removed from the UCD.</p>

<p><i>Table 1</i> lists the properties that are formally deprecated as of
this version of the Unicode Standard.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 <a name="Stabilized_Properties">Stabilized Properties</a></h4>

<p>Another possibility is that an obsolete property may be
declared to be <i>stabilized</i>. Such a determination does not indicate that
the property should or should not be used; instead it is a declaration that the
UTC will no longer actively maintain the property or extend it for newly
encoded characters. The property values of a
stabilized property are frozen as of a particular release of the standard.</p>

<p>A stabilized property is never removed from the UCD.</p>

<h2>3 <a name="Documentation_Files">Documentation</a></h2>

<p>This annex provides the core documentation for the UCD, but
additional information about character properties is available in
other parts of the standard and in additional documentation files
contained within the UCD.</p>

<h3>3.1 <a name="Character_Properties">Character Properties in the Standard</a></h3>

  <p>The formal definitions related to character properties used
  by the Unicode Standard are documented in 
  <i>Section 3.5, Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].
  Understanding those definitions and related terminology is
  essential to the appropriate use of Unicode character properties.</p>

  <p>See <i>Section 4.1, Unicode Character Database</i>, in 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for a general 
  discussion of the UCD and its use in defining properties. The
  rest of Chapter 4 provides important explanations regarding
  the meaning and use of various normative character properties.</p>

<h3>3.2 <a name="Property_Model">The Character Property Model</a></h3>

  <p>For a general discussion of the property model which underlies
  the definitions associated with the UCD, see 
  Unicode Technical Report #23, "The Unicode Character Property Model" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UTR23">UTR23</a>].
  That technical report is informative, but over the years various
  content from it has been incorporated into normative portions
  of the Unicode Standard, particularly for the definitions in
  Chapter 3.</p>
  
  <p>UTR #23 also discusses string functions and their relation to
  character properties.</p>

<h3>3.3 <a name="NamesList">NamesList.html</a></h3>

<p>NamesList.html formally describes the format of the NamesList.txt data file in BNF.
That data file is used to drive the printing 
of the Unicode code charts and names list. See also <i>Section 17.1, 
Character Names List</i>, in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] 
for a detailed discussion of the conventions used in the Unicode names list as
formatted for printing.</p>

<h3>3.4 <a name="StandardizedVariants">StandardizedVariants.html</a></h3>

<p>StandardizedVariants.html documents standardized variants, showing a 
representative glyph for each. It is closely tied to the data file, 
StandardizedVariants.txt, which defines those sequences normatively.</p>

<h3>3.5 <a name="Unihan">Unihan and UAX #38</a></h3>

<p>Unicode Standard Annex #38, "Unicode Han Database (Unihan)" 
[<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>] describes 
the format and content of the Unihan Database, which collects together all property information 
for CJK Unified Ideographs. That annex also specifies in detail
which of the Unihan character properties are normative,
informative, or provisional.</p>

<p>The Unihan Database contains extensive and detailed mapping 
information for CJK Unified Ideographs encoded in the Unicode Standard, 
but it is aimed <i>only</i> at those ideographs, not at other characters used in the East 
Asian context in general.
In contrast, East Asian legacy character sets, including important 
commercial and national character set standards, contain many non-CJK 
characters. As a result, the Unihan Database must be supplemented from 
other sources to establish mapping tables for those character sets.</p>

<p>The majority of the content of the Unihan Database is
released for each version of the Unicode Standard as a collection of Unihan data
files in the UCD. Because of their large size, these data files are released only as
a zipped file, Unihan.zip. The details of the particular data files in Unihan.zip
and the CJK properties each one contains are provided in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].
For versions of the UCD prior to Version 5.2.0, all of the CJK properties were
listed together in a very large, single file, Unihan.txt.</p>

<h3>3.6 <a name="Data_File_Comments">Data File Comments</a></h3>

<p>In addition to the specific documentation files for the UCD, individual data 
files often contain extensive header comments describing their content and any 
special conventions used in the data.</p>

<p>In some instances, individual property 
definition sections also contain comments with information about how the property 
may be derived. Such comments are informative; while they are intended
to convey the intent of the derivation, in case of any mismatch between
a statement of a derivation in a comment field and the actual
listing of the derived property, the list is considered to be definitive.
See <a href="#Simple_Derived">Simple and Derived Properties</a>.</p>

<h3>3.7 <a name="Obsolete">Obsolete Documentation Files</a></h3>

<p>UCD.html was formerly the primary documentation file for the UCD. As of Version 5.2.0, its
content has been wholly incorporated into this document.</p>

<p>Unihan.html was formerly the primary documentation file for 
the Unihan Database. As of Version 5.1.0, its
content has been wholly incorporated into [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].</p>

<p>Versions of the Unicode Standard 
prior to Version 4.0.0 contained small, focussed
documentation files, UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html, PropList.html, and
DerivedProperties.html, which were later consolidated into UCD.html.</p>

<h2>4 <a name="UCD_Files">UCD Files</a></h2>
  
  <p>The heart of the UCD consists of the data files themselves. This section
  describes the directory structure for the UCD, the format conventions
  for the data files, and provides documentation for data files not documented
  elsewhere in this annex.</p>

<h3>4.1 <a name="Directory_Structure">Directory Structure</a></h3>

  <p>Each version of the UCD is released in a separate, numbered directory
  under the <i>Public</i> directory on the Unicode Web site. The content of that
  directory is complete for that release. It is also stable&#x2014;once released,
  it will be archived permanently in that directory, unchanged, at a stable URL.</p>
  
  <p>The specific files for the UCD associated with this version of 
  the Unicode Standard (6.0.0) are located at:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/6.0.0/">http://www.unicode.org/Public/6.0.0/</a>
  </blockquote>

<h4>4.1.1 <a name="UCD_Proper">UCD Files Proper</a></h4>

  <p>The UCD proper is located in the <i>ucd</i> subdirectory of the numbered version
  directory. That directory contains all of the documentation files and most
  of the data files for the UCD, including some data files for derived properties.</p>
  
  <p>Although all UCD data files are version-specific for a release and most contain
  internal date and version stamps, the file names of the released data files do not
  differ from version to version. When linking to a version-specific data file, the
  version will be indicated by the version number of the directory for the release.</p>
  
  <p>All files for derived extracted properties are in the <i>extracted</i> 
	subdirectory of the <i>ucd</i> subdirectory. 
	See <a href="#Derived_Extracted">Derived Extracted Properties</a> for
	documentation regarding those data files and their content.</p> 

   <p>A number of auxiliary properties are specified in files in the <i>auxiliary</i>
	 subdirectory of the <i>ucd</i> subdirectory. In Version 6.0.0 it contains 
    data files specifying properties associated with 
    Unicode Standard Annex #29, "Unicode Text Segmentation" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>]
    and with
    Unicode Standard Annex #14, "Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>],
    as well as test data for those algorithms.
    See <a href="#Segmentation_Test_Files">Segmentation Test Files and Documentation</a>
    for more information about the test data.</p>
	 
<h4>4.1.2 <a name="UCD_XML_Files">UCD XML Files</a></h4>

  <p>The XML version of the UCD is located in the <i>ucdxml</i> subdirectory of the
  numbered version directory. See the <a href="#UCD_in_XML">UCD in XML</a> for
  more details.</p>

<h4>4.1.3 <a name="Chart_Files">Charts</a></h4>

  <p>The code charts specific to a version of Unicode are archived 
  as a single large pdf file in the <i>charts</i> subdirectory of the
  numbered version directory. See the readme.txt in that subdirectory
  and the general web page explaining the 
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/About.html">Unicode Code Charts</a> for
  more details.</p>
  
<h4>4.1.4 <a name="Beta_Review">Beta Review Considerations</a></h4>

  <p>Prior to the formal release for any particular version of the UCD, a beta
  review is conducted. The beta review files are located in the same directory
  that is later used for the released UCD, but during the beta review period,
  the subdirectory structure differs somewhat and may contain temporary files,
  including documentation of diffs between deltas for the beta review. Also,
  during the beta review, all data file names are suffixed with version
  numbers and delta numbers. So a typical file name during beta review
  may be "PropList-5.2.0d13.txt" instead of the finally released "PropList.txt".</p>
  
  <p>Notices contained in a ReadMe.txt file in the UCD directory during the
  beta review period also make it clear that that directory contains
  preliminary material under review, rather than a final, stable release.</p>
  
<h4>4.1.5 <a name="Directory_History">File Directory Differences for Early Releases</a></h4>

  <p>The <a href="#UCD_in_XML">UCD in XML</a> was introduced in Version 5.1.0,
  so UCD directories prior to that do not contain the <i>ucdxml</i> subdirectory.</p>
  
  <p>UCD directories prior to Version 4.1.0 do not contain the <i>auxiliary</i>
  subdirectory.</p>
  
  <p>UCD directories prior to Version 3.2.0 do not contain the <i>extracted</i>
  subdirectory.</p>
  
  <p>The general structure of the file directory for a released version of the UCD
  described above applies to Versions 4.1.0 and later. Prior to Version 4.1.0,
  versions of the UCD were not self-contained, complete sets of data files
  for that version, but instead only contained any new data files or any data files
  which had <i>changed</i> since the prior release.</p>
  
  <p>Because of this, the property files for a given version
  prior to Version 4.1.0 can be spread over several directories. Consult the
  component listings at
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/enumeratedversions.html">Enumerated Versions</a>
  to find out which files in which directories comprise a complete set of data
  files for that version.</p>

  <p>The directory naming conventions and the file naming conventions also
  differed prior to Version 4.1.0. So, for example, Version 4.0.0 of the UCD
  is contained in a directory named <i>4.0-Update</i>, and Version 4.0.1 of
  the UCD in a directory named <i>4.0-Update1</i>. Furthermore, for these
  earlier versions, the data file names <i>do</i> contain explicit version
  numbers.</p>
  	
<h3>4.2 <a name="Format_Conventions">File Format Conventions</a></h3>

  <p>Files in the UCD use the format conventions described in
  this section, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<h4>4.2.1 <a name="Data_Fields">Data Fields</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Each line of data consists of fields separated by semicolons. The fields are numbered 
    starting with zero.</li>
    <li>The first field (0) of each line in the Unicode Character Database files represents a code 
    point or range. The remaining fields (1..n) are properties associated with that code point.</li>
    <li>Leading and trailing spaces within a field are not significant.
    However, no leading or trailing spaces
    are allowed in any field of UnicodeData.txt.</li>
    <li>The Unihan data files in the UCD have a separate format, using tab characters
    instead of semicolons to separate fields. See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>]
    for the detailed specification of the format of the Unihan data files.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.2 <a name="Code_Points">Code Points and Sequences</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Code points are expressed as hexadecimal numbers with four to six digits. 
    They are written without the &quot;U+&quot; prefix in
    all data files except the Unihan data files. The Unihan data files use the &quot;U+&quot; prefix for
    all Unicode code points, to distinguish them from other decimal and hexadecimal
    numerical references occurring in their data fields.</li>
    <li>When a data field contains a sequence of code points, spaces separate
    the code points. 
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.3 <a name="Code_Point_Ranges">Code Point Ranges</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>A range of code points is specified by the form &quot;X..Y&quot;.</li> 
    <li>Each code point in a range has the 
    associated property value specified on a data file. For example (from Blocks.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
0000..007F; Basic Latin
0080..00FF; Latin-1 Supplement
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>For backward compatibility, ranges in the file UnicodeData.txt 
    are specified by entries for the 
    start and end characters of the range, rather than by the form &quot;X..Y&quot;. 
    The start character is indicated by a range identifier, followed by a comma
    and the string &quot;First&quot;, in angle brackets. This entry takes the
    place of a regular character name in field 1 for that line.
    The end character is indicated on the next line with the same range identifier,
    followed by a comma and the string &quot;Last&quot;, in angle brackets:
 
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
4E00;&lt;CJK Ideograph, First&gt;;Lo;0;L;;;;;N;;;;;
9FC3;&lt;CJK Ideograph, Last&gt;;Lo;0;L;;;;;N;;;;;
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    For character ranges using this convention, the names of all characters in the range 
    are algorithmically derivable.  
    See <i>Section 4.8, Name&mdash;Normative</i> 
    in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for more information on 
    derivation of character names for such ranges.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.4 <a name="Comments">Comments</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (&quot;#&quot;) is used to indicate comments: all 
    characters from the number sign to the end 
    of the line are considered part of the comment, and are disregarded when parsing data.</li>
    <li>In many files, the comments on data 
    lines use a common format, as illustrated here (from Scripts.txt):
    <blockquote>
       <pre>09B2          ; Bengali # Lo       BENGALI LETTER LA</pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>The first part of a comment using this common format is the General_Category value,
    provided for information. This is followed by the character name for
    the code point in the first field (0).</li>
    <li>The printing of the General_Category value is suppressed in instances where
    it would be redundant, as for DerivedGeneralCategory.txt, in which the value
    of the property value in the data field is already the General_Category value.</li>
    <li>The symbol &quot;L&amp;&quot; 
    indicates characters of General_Category Lu, Ll, or Lt (uppercase, lowercase,
    or titlecase letter). For example:
    <blockquote>
       <pre>0386          ; Greek # L&amp;       GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH TONOS</pre>
    </blockquote>
    L&amp; as used in these comments is an alias for
    the derived LC value for the General_Category property, as documented in 
    PropertyValueAliases.txt.</li>
    <li>When the data line contains a range of code points, this common format
    for a comment also indicates a range of character names, separated by &quot;..&quot;, as
    illustrated here:
    <blockquote>
      <pre>00BC..00BE ; numeric # No [3] VULGAR FRACTION ONE QUARTER..VULGAR FRACTION THREE QUARTERS</pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>Normally, consecutive characters with the same property value would be 
    represented by a single code point range. In data files using this 
    comment convention, such ranges are subdivided so that all 
    characters in a range also 
    have the same General_Category value (or LC).
    While this convention results in more ranges than are strictly necessary, it 
    makes the contents of the ranges clearer.</li>
    <li>When a code point range occurs, the number of items in the range is
    included in the comment (in square brackets), immediately following the General_Category value.</li>
    <li>The comments are purely informational, and may change format or be omitted in the 
    future. They should not be parsed for content.</li>
   </ul>
   
<h4>4.2.5 <a name="Code_Point_Labels">Code Point Labels</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Surrogate code points, private-use characters, control codes, noncharacters,
    and unassigned code points have no names. When such code points are
    listed in the data files, for example to list their General_Category
    values, the comments use code point labels instead of character
    names. For example (from DerivedCoreProperties.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>2065..2069    ; Default_Ignorable_Code_Point # Cn   [5] &lt;reserved-2065&gt;..&lt;reserved-2069&gt;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>Code point labels use one of the tags as documented in
    <i>Section 4.8, Name&mdash;Normative</i> 
    in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] and as shown in <i>Table 3</i>, 
    followed by &quot;-&quot; and the code point expressed in hexadecimal. The
    entire label is then enclosed in angle brackets.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="caption"><a name="Label_Tags_Table"></a>Table 3. Code Point Label Tags</p>
  <div align="center">
  
  <table>
   <tr>
      <th>Tag</th>

      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
  
<h4>4.2.6 <a name="Multiple_Values">Multiple Values</a></h4>

  <ul>
   <li>When a file contains the specification for multiple properties, the second field specifies the name 
    of the property and the third field specifies the property value. For example (from
    DerivedNormalizationProps.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
03D2  ; FC_NFKC; 03C5           # L&amp;  GREEK UPSILON WITH HOOK SYMBOL
03D3  ; FC_NFKC; 03CD           # L&amp;  GREEK UPSILON WITH ACUTE AND HOOK SYMBOL
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.7 <a name="Binary_Values">Binary Property Values</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>For binary properties, the second field specifies the name of the applicable property, with 
    the implied value of the property being &quot;True&quot;. Only the ranges of characters with the binary 
    property value of &quot;Y&quot; (= True) are listed. For example (from PropList.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
1680       ; White_Space # Zs      OGHAM SPACE MARK
180E       ; White_Space # Zs      MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR
2000..200A ; White_Space # Zs [11] EN QUAD..HAIR SPACE
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.8 <a name="Default_Values">Default Values</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Entries for a code point may be omitted in a data file if the 
    code point has a default value for the property in question.</li>
    
    <li>For string properties, 
    including the definition of foldings, the 
    default value is the code point of the character itself.</li>
    
    <li>For miscellaneous properties which take strings as values,
    such as the Unicode Name property, the default value is a null
    string.</li>
    
    <li>For binary properties, the default value is always &quot;N&quot; (= False)
    and is always omitted.</li>
    
    <li>For enumerated and catalog properties, the default value is listed in a comment. For 
    example (from Scripts.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#  All code points not explicitly listed for Script
#  have the value Unknown (Zzzz).
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    
    <li>A few properties of the enumerated type have multiple default values. In
    those cases, comments in the file explain the code point ranges for applicable values.
    See <i>Table 4</i>.</li>
    
    <li>Default values may also be listed in specially formatted comment lines,
    using the keyword &quot;@missing&quot;. For example:
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
# @missing: 0000..10FFFF; Unknown
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    
    <li>Because of the legacy format constraints for UnicodeData.txt, that
    file contains no specific information about default values for properties.
    The default values for fields in UnicodeData.txt are documented 
    in the Default Values for Properties table below
    if they cannot be derived from the general rules about default values
    for properties.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Default values for common catalog, enumeration, and
  numeric properties are listed in <i>Table 4</i>.</p>
  
  <p class="caption"><a name="Default_Values_Table"></a>Table 4. Default Values for Properties</p>

  <p>Default values for the Unicode character property
  <a href="#Bidi_Class">Bidi_Class</a> are complex. See  
  Unicode Standard Annex #9, "The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX9">UAX9</a>]
  and DerivedBidiClass.txt for more details.</p>

  <p>Default values for the <a href="#East_Asian_Width">East_Asian_Width</a>
  property are also complex. This property defaults to Neutral for most code points, but defaults to Wide
  for unassigned code points in blocks associated with CJK ideographs. See Unicode Standard Annex #11, "East Asian Width"
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX11">UAX11</a>] and DerivedEastAsianWidth.txt for more details.</p>
    
<h4>4.2.9 <a name="Text_Encoding">Text Encoding</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>The data files use UTF-8. Unless otherwise noted, non-ASCII characters only 
    appear in comments.</li>
    <li>The Unihan data files in the UCD make extensive use of UTF-8 in data fields.
    (See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>] for details.)</li>
    <li>For legacy reasons, NamesList.txt is exceptional; it
    is encoded in Latin-1. See <a href="#NamesList">NamesList.html</a></li>
    <li>Segmentation test data files, such as WordBreakTest.txt, make
    use of non-ASCII (UTF-8) characters as delimiters for data fields.</li>
  </ul>
    
<h4>4.2.10 <a name="Line_Termination">Line Termination</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>All data files in the UCD use LF line termination (not CRLF line termination). 
    When copied to different systems, these line endings may be automatically changed to
    use the native line termination conventions for that system. Make sure your editor (or parser) can 
    deal with the line termination 
    style in the local copy of the data files.</li>
  </ul>
    
<h4>4.2.11 <a name="Other_Conventions">Other Conventions</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>In some test data files, segments of the test data are distinguished by a line 
    starting with an &quot;@&quot; sign. For example (from NormalizationTest.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
@Part1 # Character by character test
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.12 <a name="Other_File_Formats">Other File Formats</a></h4>

  <ul>    
    <li>The data format for Unihan data files
    in the UCD differs from the standard format. 
	See the discussion of <a href="#Unihan">Unihan and UAX #38</a> 
	earlier in this annex for more information.</li>
    <li>The format for NamesList.txt, which documents the Unicode names
    list and which is used programmatically to drive the formatting
    program for Unicode code charts, also differs significantly from regular UCD data files.
    See <a href="#NamesList">NamesList.html</a></li>
    <li>Index.txt is another exception. It uses a tab-delimited format, with field 0
    consisting of an index entry string, and field 1 a code point. Index.txt is used to
    maintain the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/charindex.html">
    Unicode Character Name Index</a>.</li>
    <li>The various segmentation test data files make use of &quot;#&quot; to delimit comments,
    but have distinct conventions for their data fields. See the documentation
    in their header sections for details of the data field formats for
    those files.</li>
    <li>The XML version of the UCD has its own file format conventions.
    In those files, "#" is used to stand for the code point in
    algorithmically derivable character names such as CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E00,
    so as to allow for name sharing in more compact representations of the data.
    See Unicode Standard Annex #42, "Unicode Character Database in XML" 
    [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX42">UAX42</a>] for details.</li>  
  </ul>

<h3>4.3 <a name="File_List">File List</a></h3>

  <p>The exact list of files associated with any particular version of the UCD is
  available on the Unicode Web site by referring to the component listings at
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/enumeratedversions.html">Enumerated Versions</a>.</p>
  
  <p>The majority of the data files in the UCD provide specifications of
  character properties for Unicode characters. Those files and their contents
  are documented in detail in the <a href="#Property_Definitions">Property Definitions</a> section
  below.</p>
  
  <p>The data files in the <i>extracted</i> subdirectory constitute reformatted listings
  of single character properties extracted from UnicodeData.txt or other primary
  data files. The reformatting is provided to make it easier to see the particular set
  of characters having certain values for enumerated properties, or to separate
  the statement of that property from other properties defined together
  in UnicodeData.txt. These extracted, derived data files are further documented in
  the <a href="#Derived_Extracted">Derived Extracted Properties</a> section below.</p>
  
  <p>The UCD also contains a number of test data files, whose purpose is to provide
  standard test cases useful in verifying the implementation of complex Unicode
  algorithms. See the <a href="#Test_Files">Test Files</a> section below for more
  documentation.</p>

  <p>The remaining files in the Unicode Character Database do not directly specify Unicode 
  properties. The important ones and their functions are listed in <i>Table 5</i>.
  The Status column indicates whether the file (and its content) is considered 
  <b>N</b>ormative, <b>I</b>nformative, or <b>P</b>rovisional.</p>

<h3>4.4 <a name="Zipped_Files">Zipped Files</a></h3>

  <p>Starting with Version 4.1.0, zipped versions of all of the UCD files,
  both data files and documentation files, are available under the <i>Public/zipped</i>
  directory on the Unicode Web site. Each collection of zipped files is located
  there in a numbered subdirectory corresponding to that version of the UCD.</p>
  
  <p>Two different zipped files are provided for each version:</p>

  <ul>  
  <li><b>Unihan.zip</b> is the zipped version of the very large Unihan data
  files</li>
  <li><b>UCD.zip</b> is the zipped
  version of all of the rest of the UCD data files, excluding 
  the Unihan data files.</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>This bifurcation allows for better management of downloading version-specific
  information, because Unihan.zip contains all the pertinent CJK-related
  property information, while UCD.zip contains all of the rest of the UCD
  property information, for those who may not need the voluminous CJK data.</p>
  
  <p>In versions of the UCD prior to Version 4.1.0, zipped copies of the
  Unihan data files (which for those versions were released as a single large text file, Unihan.txt)
  are provided in the same directory as the UCD data files. These zipped files are only posted 
  for versions of the UCD in which Unihan.txt was updated.</p>

<h3>4.5 <a name="UCD_in_XML">UCD in XML</a></h3>

<p>Starting with Version 5.1.0, a set of XML data 
files are also released with each version of the UCD. Those 
data files make it possible to import and process the UCD property data using 
standard XML parsing tools, instead of the specialized parsing required for the 
various individual data files of the UCD.</p>

<h4>4.5.1 <a name="UAX42_doc">UAX #42</a></h4>

<p>Unicode Standard Annex #42, "Unicode Character Database in XML" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX42">UAX42</a>] 
defines an XML schema 
which is used to incorporate all of the Unicode character property information 
into the XML version of the UCD. See that annex for details of the
schema and conventions regarding the grouping of property values for
more compact representations.</p>

<h4>4.5.2 <a name="XML_files">XML File List</a></h4>

  <p>The XML version of the UCD is contained in the <i>ucdxml</i> subdirectory
  of the UCD. The files are all zipped. The list of files is shown in
  <i>Table 6</i>.</p>

    <p>The "flat" file versions simply list all attributes with no
    particular compression. The "grouped" file versions apply the
    grouping mechanism described in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX42">UAX42</a>]
    to cut down on the size of the data files.</p>

<h2>5 <a name="Properties">Properties</a></h2>

  <p>This section documents the Unicode character properties, relating them

  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].</p>

<h3>5.2 <a name="About_Property_Table">About the Property Table</a></h3>

  <p><i>Table 9, <a href="#Property_List_Table">Property Table</a></i> 
  specifies the list of character properties
  defined in the UCD. 
  That table is divided into separate sections for each data
  file in the UCD. Data files which define a single property or a small number of properties are listed 
  first, followed by the data files which define a
  large number of properties: <a href="#DerivedCoreProperties.txt">DerivedCoreProperties.txt</a>,
  <a href="#DerivedNormalizationProps.txt">DerivedNormalizationProps.txt</a>,
  <a href="#PropList.txt">PropList.txt</a>, and <a href="#UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a>.
  In some instances for these files defining many properties, the
  entries in the property table are grouped by type, for clarity in presentation, rather than
  being listed alphabetically.</p>
    
  <p>In <i>Table 9,
  <a href="#Property_List_Table">Property Table</a></i> each property is described as follows:</p>
  
  <p><b>First Column.</b> This column contains the name of each of the character properties
  specified in the respective data file.
    Any special status for a property, such
    as whether it is <a href="#Obsolete_Properties">obsolete</a>, 
    <a href="#Deprecated_Properties">deprecated</a>, or 
    <a href="#Stabilized_Properties">stabilized</a>, is also indicated in
    the first column.</p>

  <p><b>Second Column.</b> This column 
  indicates the type of the property, according to the 
  key in <i>Table 8</i>.</p>

  <ul>  
  <li><b>Catalog</b> properties have enumerated values which are expected 
  to be regularly extended in successive versions of the Unicode Standard. This distinguishes them 
  from Enumeration properties.</li>
  <li><b>Enumeration</b> properties have enumerated values 
  which constitute a logical partition space; 
  new values will generally not be added to them in successive versions of the standard.</li>
  <li><b>Binary</b> properties are a special case of Enumeration properties, which
  have exactly two values: Yes and No (or True and False).</li>
  <li><b>String</b> properties
  are typically mappings from a Unicode code point to another Unicode code point
  or sequence of Unicode code points; examples include case mappings and
  decomposition mappings.</li>
  <li><b>Numeric</b> properties specify the actual numeric values
  for digits and other characters associated with numbers in some way.</li>
  <li><b>Miscellaneous</b> properties are those properties that do not fit neatly into the other 
  property categories; they currently include character names, comments about characters, 
  and the Unicode_Radical_Stroke property (a combination of numeric values)
  documented in Unicode Standard Annex #38, "Unicode Han Database (Unihan)" 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><b>Third Column.</b> This column indicates the 
  status of the property: <b>N</b>ormative or <b>I</b>nformative or <b>C</b>ontributory
  or <b>P</b>rovisional.</p>
  
  <p><b>Fourth Column.</b> This column provides a description of 
  the property or properties. This includes information on derivation for
  derived properties, as well as references to locations in the standard
  where the property is defined or discussed in detail.</p>
  
  <p>In the section of the table for <a href="#UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a>, 
  the data field numbers are also supplied in parentheses at the
  start of the description.</p>
  
  <p>For a few entries in the property table, values specified in the fields in a 
  data file only contribute to a full definition of a Unicode character property.
  For example, the values in field 1 (Name) in
  UnicodeData.txt do not provide all the values for the Name 
  property for all code points; <a href="#Jamo.txt">Jamo.txt</a> must also be used,
  and the Name property for CJK Unified Ideographs is derived by rule.</p>
  
  <p>None of the Unicode character properties should be used simply on the
  basis of the descriptions in the property table without consulting the relevant 
  discussions in the Unicode Standard. Because of the enormous variety of
  characters in the repertoire of the Unicode Standard, character properties
  tend not to be self-evident in application, even when the names of the
  properties may seem familiar from their usage with much smaller legacy
  character encodings.</p>

      This maps a subset of characters with the Bidi_Mirrored property to other
      characters that normally are displayed with the corresponding mirrored glyph.
      When a character with the Bidi_Mirrored property has
      the default value for Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph, that means that no other character
      exists whose glyph is appropriate for character-based glyph mirroring.
      Implementations must then use other mechanisms to implement mirroring of those
      characters for the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.

  <p>For the extraction of Decomposition_Type, characters with canonical
  decomposition mappings in field 5 of UnicodeData.txt have no tag. For
  those characters, the extracted value is Decomposition_Type=Canonical. For characters
  with compatibility decomposition mappings, there are explicit tags
  in field 5, and the value of Decomposition_Type
  is equivalent to those tags. The value Decomposition_Type=Canonical is
  normative. Other values for Decomposition_Type are informative.</p>
  
  <p>Numeric_Value is extracted based on the actual numeric value of the
  data in field 8 of UnicodeData.txt or the values
  of the kPrimaryNumeric, kAccountingNumeric, or kOtherNumeric tags, for
  characters listed in the Unihan data files.</p>
  
  <p>Numeric_Type is extracted as follows. If fields 6, 7, and 8 in UnicodeData.txt
  are all non-empty, then Numeric_Type=Decimal. Otherwise, if fields 7 and 8 are both
  non-empty, then Numeric_Type=Digit. Otherwise, if field 8 is non-empty, then
  Numeric_Type=Numeric. 
  For characters listed in the Unihan data files,
  Numeric_Type=Numeric for characters that have kPrimaryNumeric, kAccountingNumeric,
  or kOtherNumeric tags. The default value is Numeric_Type=None.</p>
  
<h3>5.5 <a name="Contributory_Properties">Contributory Properties</a></h3>

  <p>Contributory properties contain sets of exceptions used in the generation of
  other properties derived from them. The contributory properties specifically concerned with
  identifiers and casing contribute to the maintenance of
  stability guarantees for properties and/or to invariance relationships
  between related properties. Other contributory properties are simply
  defined as a convenience for property derivation.</p>
  
  <p>Most contributory properties have names using
  the pattern "Other_XXX" and are used to derive the corresponding "XXX" property.
  For example, the Other_Alphabetic property is used in the derivation of the <a href="#Alphabetic">Alphabetic</a>
  property.</p>
  
  <p>Contributory properties are typically defined in 
  <a href="#PropList.txt">PropList.txt</a> and the corresponding derived property
  is then listed in
  <a href="#DerivedCoreProperties.txt">DerivedCoreProperties.txt</a>.
  
  <p><a href="#Jamo_Short_Name">Jamo_Short_Name</a> is an unusual contributory
  property, both in terms of its name and how it is used. It is defined in
  its own property file, Jamo.txt, and is used to derive the Name
  property value for Hangul syllable characters, according to the rules
  spelled out in <i>Section 3.12, Conjoining Jamo Behavior</i> in
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  
  <p><i>Contributory</i> is considered to be a distinct status for a Unicode
  character property. Contributory properties are neither <i>normative</i> nor
  <i>informative</i>. This distinct status is marked in the property table.</p>
  
  <p>Contributory properties are 
	incomplete by themselves and are not intended for independent use. For example, 
	an API returning Unicode property values should implement the derived 
	core properties such as Alphabetic or Default_Ignorable_Code_Point,
	rather than the corresponding contributory properties,
	Other_Alphabetic or Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point.</p>
	
  
<h3>5.6 <a name="Casemapping">Case and Case Mapping</a></h3>

  <p>Case for bicameral scripts and case mapping of characters are
  complicated topics in the Unicode Standard&#x2014;both because of
  their inherent algorithmic complexity and because of the number of characters
  and special edge cases involved.</p>
  
  <p>This section provides a brief roadmap to discussions about these
  topics, and specifications and definitions in the standard, as well
  as explaining which case-related properties are defined in the UCD.</p>
  
  <p><i>Section 3.13, Default Case Algorithms</i> in
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
  provides formal definitions for a number of case-related concepts (<i>cased</i>,
  <i>case-ignorable</i>,&nbsp;...), for
  case conversion (<i>toUppercase(X)</i>,&nbsp;...), and for case detection
  (<i>isUppercase(X)</i>,&nbsp;...). It also provides the formal definition
  of caseless matching for the standard, taking normalization
  into account.</p>
  
  <p><i>Section 4.2, Case&#x2014;Normative</i> in
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
  introduces case and case mapping properties. <i>Table 4-1, Sources
  for Case Mapping Information</i> 
  in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] describes the kind of case-related
  information that is available in various data files of the UCD.
  <i>Table 11</i> lists those data files again, giving the
  explicit list of case-related properties defined in each. 
  The link on each property leads its description in 
  <i>Table 9, <a href="#Property_List_Table">Property Table</a></i>.</p>

  </div>
    
  <p>For compatibility with existing parsers, UnicodeData.txt only 
  contains case mappings for characters where they constitute one-to-one mappings; 
  it also omits 
  information about context-sensitive case mappings. Information about 
  these special cases can be found in the separate data file, 
  SpecialCasing.txt, expressed as separate properties.</p>

  <p><i>Section 5.18, Case Mappings</i>, in
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
  discusses various implementation issues for handling case,
  including language-specific case mapping, as for Greek and
  for Turkish. That section also describes case folding in particular detail.</p>
  
  <p>The special casing conditions associated with case mapping for Greek,
  Turkish, and Lithuanian are specified in an additional field in
  <a href="#SpecialCasing.txt">SpecialCasing.txt</a>. For example, the
  lowercase mapping for sigma in Greek varies according to its position
  in a word. The condition list does not constitute a formal character
  property in the UCD, because it is a statement about the context of occurrence
  of casing behavior for a character or characters, rather than a semantic
  attribute of those characters. Versions of the UCD from
  Version 3.2.0 to Version 5.0.0 <i>did</i> list property aliases
  for Special_Case_Condition (scc), but this was determined to be an error
  when the UCD was analyzed for representation in XML; consequently,
  the Special_Case_Condition property aliases were removed as of Version 5.1.0.</p>
  
  <p>Caseless matching is of particular concern for a number of text
  processing algorithms, so is also discussed at some length
  in Unicode Standard Annex #31, "Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax" 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX31">UAX31</a>] and
  in Unicode Technical Standard #10, "Unicode Collation Algorithm"
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UTS10">UTS10</a>].</p>
  
  <p>Further information about locale-specific casing conventions
  can be found in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#CLDR">CLDR</a>].</p>
  
  <h3>5.7 <a name="Property_Values">Property Value Lists</a></h3>

  <p>The following subsections give summaries of property values for certain 
  Enumeration properties. Other property values 
  are documented in other, topically-specific annexes; for example, 
  the Line_Break property values are documented in
  Unicode Standard Annex #14, "Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm"
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>] and the
  various segmentation-related property values are documented in
  Unicode Standard Annex #29, "Unicode Text Segmentation"
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>].</p>
  
<h4>5.7.1 <a name="General_Category_Values">General Category Values</a></h4>
  
  <p>The General_Category property of a code point provides for the 
  most general classification of that code point. It is usually 
  determined based on the primary characteristic of the assigned 
  character for that code point. For example, is the character a letter, 
  a mark, a number, punctuation, or a symbol, and if so, of what 
  type? Other General_Category values define the classification of
  code points which are not assigned to regular graphic characters,
  including such statuses as private-use, control, surrogate code 
  point, and reserved unassigned.</p>
  
  <p>Many characters have multiple uses, and not all such cases 
  can be captured entirely by the General_Category value. For example,
  the General_Category value of Latin, Greek, or Hebrew letters does not
  attempt to cover (or preclude) the numerical use of such letters
  as Roman numerals or in other numerary systems. Conversely, the
  General_Category of ASCII digits 0..9 as Nd (decimal digit)
  neither attempts to cover (or preclude) the occasional use of
  these digits as letters in various orthographies. The General_Category
  is simply the first-order, most usual categorization of a
  character.</p>
  
  <p>For more information about the General_Category
  property, see <i>Chapter 4, Character Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>

  <p>The values in the General_Category field in UnicodeData.txt
  make use of the short, abbreviated property value aliases
  for General_Category. For convenience in reference, <i>Table 12</i>
  lists all the abbreviated and long value aliases for General_Category values, reproduced from

  <p>Please refer to Unicode Standard Annex #9, "The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm"
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX9">UAX9</a>] for 
  an an explanation of the significance 
  of these values when formatting bidirectional text.</p>
  
<h4>5.7.3 <a name="Character_Decomposition_Mappings">Character Decomposition Mapping</a></h4>

  <p>The value of the Decomposition_Mapping property for a character is provided
  in field 5 of UnicodeData.txt. This is a string property, consisting of a sequence
  of one or more Unicode code points. The default value of the Decomposition_Mapping
  property is the code point of the character itself. The use of the default value
  for a character is indicated by leaving field 5 empty in UnicodeData.txt.
  Informally, the value of the Decomposition_Mapping property for a character
  is known simply as its <i>decomposition mapping</i>. When a character's decomposition
  mapping is other than the default value, the decomposition mapping is printed out
  explicitly in the names list for the Unicode code charts.</p>
  
  <p>The prefixed tags supplied with a subset of the decomposition mappings generally indicate formatting 
  information. Where no such tag is given, the mapping is canonical. Conversely, the presence of a 
  formatting tag also indicates that the mapping is a compatibility mapping and not a canonical 
  mapping. In the absence of other formatting information in a compatibility mapping, the tag is 
  used to distinguish it from canonical mappings.</p>
  
  <p>In some instances a canonical mapping or a compatibility mapping may consist of a single 
  character. For a canonical mapping, this indicates that the character is a canonical equivalent of 
  another single character. For a compatibility mapping, this indicates that the character is a 
  compatibility equivalent of another single character.</p>
  
  <p>The compatibility formatting 
  tags used in the UCD are listed in <i>Table 14</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Note: </b>There is a difference between decomposition and the 
  Decomposition_Mapping property. The 
  Decomposition_Mapping property is a string property whose
  values (mappings) are defined in UnicodeData.txt, while the decomposition (also termed &quot;full 
  decomposition&quot;) is defined in <i>Section 3.7, Decomposition</i> in
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] to use those mappings <i>recursively.</i></p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The canonical decomposition is formed by recursively applying the canonical mappings, then 
    applying the Canonical Ordering Algorithm.</li>
    <li>The compatibility decomposition is formed by recursively applying the canonical <b>and</b> 
    compatibility mappings, then applying the Canonical Ordering Algorithm.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Starting from Unicode 2.1.9, the decomposition mappings in
  <a href="#UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a> can be used to derive the 
  full decomposition of any single character in canonical order, without 
  the need to separately apply the Canonical Ordering Algorithm. 
  However, canonical ordering of combining character sequences <b><i>must</i></b> still be applied 
  in decomposition when normalizing source text which contains any combining marks.</p>
  
  <p>The normalization of Hangul conjoining jamos and of Hangul syllables depends on algorithmic
  mapping, as specified in <i>Section 3.12, Conjoining Jamo Behavior</i> in 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].
  That algorithm specifies the full decomposition of all precomposed Hangul syllables, but
  effectively it is equivalent to the recursive application of pairwise decomposition
  mappings, as for all other Unicode characters. Formally, the Decomposition_Mapping
  property value for a Hangul syllable is the pairwise decomposition and not the full 
  decomposition.</p>
  
	<p>Each character with the <a href="#Hangul_Syllable_Type">Hangul_Syllable_Type</a> 
	value LVT will have a Decomposition_Mapping consisting of a character with an LV value and a 
	character with a T value. Thus for U+CE31 the Decomposition_Mapping is &lt;U+CE20, U+11B8&gt;, 
	rather than &lt;U+110E, U+1173, U+11B8&gt;.</p>
	
<h4>5.7.4 <a name="Canonical_Combining_Class_Values">Canonical Combining Class Values</a></h4>
  
  <p>The values in the Canonical_Combining_Class field in UnicodeData.txt
  are numerical values used in the Canonical Ordering Algorithm. Some of
  those numerical values also have explicit symbolic labels as property
  value aliases, to make their intended application more understandable.
  For convenience in reference, <i>Table 15</i>
  lists all the long symbolic aliases for Canonical_Combining_Class values, reproduced from
  <a href="#PropertyValueAliases.txt">PropertyValueAliases.txt</a>, 
  along with a brief description of each category.</p>

      <p>Some of the Canonical_Combining_Class values in the table are not currently used 
    for any characters but are specified here for completeness. Some
    values do not have long symbolic aliases, but these two sets are not
    congruent. Do not assume that absence of a long symbolic alias implies
    non-use of a particular Canonical_Combining_Class. See
    <a href="#DerivedCombiningClass.txt">DerivedCombiningClass.txt</a> for
    a complete listing of the use of Canonical_Combining_Class values for
    any particular version of the UCD.</p>
    
    <p>Combining marks with ccc=224 (Left) follow their base character in storage,
    as for all combining marks, but are rendered visually on the left
    side of them. For all past versions of the UCD and
    continuing with this version of the UCD, only two
    tone marks used in certain notations for Hangul syllables have ccc=224.
    Those marks are actually rendered visually on the left side of
    the preceding <i>grapheme cluster</i>, in the case of Hangul syllables
    resulting from sequences of conjoining jamos.</p>
    
    <p>Those few instances of combining marks with ccc=Left should be
    distinguished from the far more numerous examples of left-side vowel
    signs and vowel letters in Brahmi-derived scripts. 
    The Canonical_Combining_Class value is zero (Not_Reordered) for both
    ordinary, left-side (reordrant) vowel signs such as
    U+093F DEVANAGARI VOWEL SIGN I and for Thai-style left-side
    (Logical_Order_Exception=Yes) vowel letters such as U+0E40
    THAI CHARACTER SARA E. The "Not_Reordered" of ccc=Not_Reordered
    refers to the behavior of the character in terms of the Canonical
    Ordering Algorithm as part of the definition of Unicode Normalization;
    it does <i>not</i> refer to any issues of visual reordering of glyphs
    involved in display and rendering. See "Canonical Ordering
    Algorithm" in <i>Section 3.11, 
    Normalization Forms</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>

  <p>A number of derived properties related to Unicode normalization are called
  the "Quick_Check" properties. These are defined to enable various optimizations

<h3>5.8 <a name="Property_Aliases">Property and Property Value Aliases</a></h3>

  <p>Both Unicode character properties themselves and their values are
  given symbolic aliases. The formal lists of aliases are provided so that
  well-defined symbolic values are available for XML formats of the UCD
  data, for regular expression property tests, and for other
  programmatic textual descriptions of Unicode data. 
  The aliases for properties are defined in
  PropertyAliases.txt. The aliases for property values are defined in
  PropertyValueAliases.txt.</p>
  
  <p class="caption"><a name="Alias_Files_Table"></a>Table 17. Alias Files in the UCD</p>

  <p>Aliases are defined as ASCII-compatible identifiers, using only uppercase or
  lowercase A-Z, digits, and underscore "_". Case is not significant
  when comparing aliases, but the preferred form used in the data files
  for longer aliases is to titlecase them.</p>
  
  <p>Aliases may be translated in appropriate environments, and additional
  aliases may be useful in certain contexts. There is no requirement that
  only the aliases defined in the alias files of the UCD be used when
  referring to Unicode character properties or their values; however, their
  use is recommended for interoperability in data formats or in
  programmatic contexts.</p>
  
  <p>Aliases are not provided for provisional properties. This results
  from the fact that there are stability guarantees for property aliases and property
  value aliases, but no stability guarantees for provisional properties or other
  provisional data files.</p>
  
  <h4>5.8.1 Property Aliases</h4>
  
  <p>In PropertyAliases.txt, the first field specifies an abbreviated
  symbolic name for the property, and the second field specifies the
  long symbolic name for the property. These are the preferred aliases.
  Additional aliases for a few properties are specified in the third
  or subsequent fields.</p>
  
  <p>Aliases for normative and informative
  properties defined in the Unihan data files are included in PropertyAliases.txt,
  beginning with Version 5.2.</p>
  
  <p>The long symbolic name alias is self-descriptive, and is 
  treated as the official name of
  a Unicode character property. For clarity it is used whenever possible 
  when referring to that
  property in this annex and elsewhere in the Unicode Standard.
  For example: "The Line_Break property is discussed in Unicode Standard Annex #14, "Unicode Line 
  Breaking Algorithm" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>]."</p>
  
  <p>The abbreviated symbolic name alias is short and less mnemonic,
  but is useful for expressions such as "lb=BA" in data or in other 
  contexts where the meaning is clear.</p>
  
  <p>The property aliases specified in PropertyAliases.txt constitute
  a unique name space. When using these symbolic values, no
  alias for one property will match an alias for another property.</p>
  
  <h4>5.8.2 Property Value Aliases</h4>
  
  <p>In PropertyValueAliases.txt, the first field contains the
  abbreviated alias for a Unicode property, the second field specifies 
  an abbreviated symbolic name for a value of that property, and 
  the third field specifies the
  long symbolic name for that value of that property. These are the 
  preferred aliases.
  Additional aliases for some property values may be specified in the fourth
  or subsequent fields. For example, for binary properties, the
  abbreviated alias for the True value is "Y", and the long alias
  is "Yes", but each entry also specifies "T" and "True" as
  additional aliases for that value, as shown in <i>Table 18</i>.</p>
  
  <p class="caption"><a name="Binary_Values_Table"></a>Table 18. Binary Property Value Aliases</p>
  <div align="center">

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Long</th>
			<th>Abbreviated</th>
			<th>Other Aliases</th>
		</tr>

			<td>No</td>
			<td>N</td>
			<td>False, F</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
   </div>

  <p>Not every property value has an associated alias. Property value
  aliases are typically supplied for catalog and enumeration
  properties, which have well-defined, enumerated values. It does not
  make sense to specify property value aliases, for example, for
  the Numeric_Value property, whose value could be any number, or
  for a string property such as Simple_Lowercase_Mapping, whose values
  are mappings from one code point to another.</p>
  
  <p>The Canonical_Combining_Class property requires special handling
  in PropertyValueAliases.txt. The values of this property are numeric,
  but they comprise a closed, enumerated set of values. The more
  important of those values are given symbolic name aliases.
  In PropertyValueAliases.txt, the second field provides the numeric
  value, while the third field contains the abbreviated symbolic
  name alias and the fourth field contains the long symbolic
  name alias for that numeric value. For example:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  <pre>
ccc; 230; A    ; Above
ccc; 232; AR   ; Above_Right
  </pre>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Taken by themselves, property value aliases do not constitute
  a unique name space. The abbreviated aliases, in particular,
  are often re-used as aliases for values for different properties.
  All of the binary property value aliases, for example, make
  use of the same "Y", "Yes", "T", "True" symbols. Property value
  aliases may also overlap the symbols used for property aliases.
  For example, "Sc" is the abbreviated alias for the
  "Currency_Symbol" value of the General_Category value, but
  it is also the abbreviated alias for the Script property.
  However, the aliases for values for any single property are
  always unique within the context of that property. That
  means that expressions that combine a property alias and
  a property value alias, such as "lb=BA" or "gc=Sc" <i>always</i>
  refer unambiguously just to one value of one given property,
  and will not match any other value of any other property.</p>
  
  <p>The property value alias entries for three properties,
  Age, Block, and Joining_Group, make use of a special metavalue
  "n/a" in the field for the abbreviated alias. This should
  be understood as meaning that no abbreviated alias is
  defined for that value for that property, rather than as
  an alias per se.</p>
  
  <p>In a few cases, because of longstanding legacy practice
  in referring to values of a property by short identifiers,
  the abbreviated alias and the long alias are the same. This
  can be seen, for example, in some property value aliases
  for the Line_Break property and the Grapheme_Cluster_Break
  property.</p>
    
<h3>5.9 <a name="Matching_Rules">Matching Rules</a></h3>

  <p>When matching Unicode character property names 
  and values, it is strongly recommended that all 
  <a href="#Property_Aliases">Property and Property Value Aliases</a>
  be recognized. For best results in matching, rather than using
  exact binary comparisons, the following loose matching rules
  should be observed.</p> 

  <h4>Numeric Property Values</h4>
  <p>For all numeric properties, and for properties such as Unicode_Radical_Stroke 
  which are constructed from combinations 
  of numeric values, use loose matching rule UAX44-LM1 when comparing property values.</p>
  
  <p><a name="UAX44-LM1"></a><i><b>UAX44-LM1.</b></i> Apply numeric equivalences.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;01.00&quot; is equivalent to &quot;1&quot;.</li>
    <li>&quot;1.666667&quot; in the UCD is a repeating fraction, and 
    equivalent to "10/6" or "5/3".</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Character Names</h4>
  <p>Unicode character names constitute a special case. Formally, they are values
  of the Name property. While each Unicode character name for an assigned character
  is guaranteed to be unique, names are assigned in such a way that
  the presence or absence of spaces cannot be used to distinguish them. 
  Furthermore, implementations sometimes create identifiers from Unicode
  character names by inserting underscores for spaces. For best results
  in comparing Unicode character names, use loose matching rule UAX44-LM2.</p>
  
  <p><a name="UAX44-LM2"></a><i><b>UAX44-LM2.</b></i> Ignore case, whitespace, underscore (&#39;_&#39;), and all medial hyphens except the hyphen in 
  U+1180 HANGUL JUNGSEONG O-E.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;zero-width space&quot; is equivalent to &quot;ZERO WIDTH SPACE&quot; or &quot;zerowidthspace&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;character -a&quot; is <i>not</i> equivalent to &quot;character a&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In this rule "medial hyphen" is to be construed as a hyphen
  occurring immediately between two letters in the normative Unicode character
  name, as published in the Unicode names list, and not to any hyphen that may
  transiently occur medially as a result of removing whitespace before removing hyphens in
  a particular implementation of matching. Thus the hyphen in the name
  U+10089 LINEAR B IDEOGRAM B107M HE-GOAT is medial, and should be ignored
  in loose matching, but the hyphen in the name U+0F39 TIBETAN MARK TSA -PHRU is
  <i>not</i> medial, and should not be ignored in loose matching.</p>
  
  <p>An implementation of this loose matching rule can obtain
  the correct results when comparing two strings by doing the following three
  operations, in order:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>remove all medial hyphens (except the medial hyphen in the name for U+1180)</li>
    <li>remove all whitespace and underscore characters</li>
    <li>apply toLowercase() to both strings</li> 
  </ol>
  
  <p>After applying these three operations, if the two strings
  compare binary equal, then they are considered to match.</p>
  
  <p>This is a logical statement of how the rule works. If programmed
  carefully, an implementation of the matching rule can transform the strings in
  a single pass. It is also possible to compare two name strings for loose matching
  while transforming each string incrementally.</p>
  
  <p>Loose matching rule UAX44-LM2 is also appropriate for matching
  formal name aliases and the names of named character sequences, which share the
  namespace (and matching behavior) of Unicode character names.</p>
  
  <h4>Symbolic Values</h4>
  <p>Property aliases and property value aliases are symbolic values. When
  comparing them, use loose matching rule UAX44-LM3.</p>
  
  <p><a name="UAX44-LM3"></a><i><b>UAX44-LM3.</b></i> Ignore case, whitespace, underscore (&#39;_&#39;), 
  hyphens, and any initial prefix string "is".</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;linebreak&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Line_Break&quot; or &quot;Line-break&quot;</li>
    <li>"lb=BA" is equivalent to "lb=ba" or "LB=BA"</li>
    <li>"Script=Greek" is equivalent to "Script=isGreek" or "Script=Is_Greek"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Loose matching is generally appropriate for the property values of
  Catalog, Enumeration, and Binary properties, which have symbolic aliases
  defined for their values.  
  Loose matching should not be done for the property values of String properties, 
  which do not have symbolic aliases defined for their values; exact
  matching for String property values is important, as 
  case distinctions or other distinctions in those values may be significant.</p>
  
  <p>For loose matching of symbolic values, an initial prefix string "is" is
  ignored. The reason for this is that APIs returning property values are often
  named using the convention of prefixing "is" (or "Is" or "Is_", and so forth) to
  a property value. Ignoring any initial "is" on a symbolic value during loose
  matching is likely to produce the best results in application areas such as
  regex. Removal of an initial "is" string for a loose matching comparison only
  needs to be done once for a symbolic value, and need not be tested recursively.
  There are no property aliases or property value aliases of the form
  "isisisisistooconvoluted" defined just to test implementation edge cases.</p>
  
  <p>Existing and future property aliases and property value
  aliases are guaranteed to be unique within their relevant namespaces, even
  if an initial prefix string "is" is ignored. The existing cases of note
  for aliases that do start with "is" are: dt=Iso (Decomposition_Type=Isolated)
  and lb=IS. The Decomposition_Type value alias does not cause any problem,
  because there is no contrasting value alias dt=o (Decomposition_Type=olated).
  For lb=IS, note that the "IS" is the <i>entire</i> property value alias, and
  is not a prefix. There is no null value for the Line_Break property for it
  to contrast with, but implementations of loose matching should be careful
  of this edge case, so that "lb=IS" is not misinterpreted as matching a null
  value.</p>
  
  <p>Implementations sometimes use other syntactic constructs
  that interact with loose matching. For example, the property matching
  expression \p{L} may be defaulted to refer to the Unicode General_Category
  property: \p{General_Category=L}. For more information about
  the use of property values in regular expressions and other environments,
  see <i>Section 1.2, Properties</i>, in Unicode Technical Standard #18,
  "Unicode Regular Expressions" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>]</p>

<h3>5.10 <a name="Invariants">Invariants</a></h3>

  <p>Property values in the UCD may be subject to correction
  in subsequent versions of the standard, as errors are found. Also,
  some multi-valued properties such as Line_Break or Word_Break may
  have additional values defined for them. However, some property values
  and some aspects of the file formats are considered
  invariant. This section documents such invariants.</p>
  
  <h4>5.10.1 <a name="Property_Invariants">Character Property Invariants</a></h4>
  
  <p>All formally guaranteed invariants for properties or property values 
  are described in
  the Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policy 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Stability">Stability</a>].
  That policy and the list of invariants it enumerates are
  maintained outside the context of the Unicode Standard per se.
  They are not part of the standard, but rather are constraints
  on what can and cannot change in the standard between versions,
  and on what decisions the Unicode Technical Committee can and
  cannot take regarding the standard.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to the formally guaranteed invariants described
  in the Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policy, this section
  notes a few additional points regarding character property
  invariants in the UCD.</p>
  
  <p>Some character properties are simply considered <i>immutable</i>: once
  assigned, they are never changed. For example, a character's name
  is immutable, because of its importance in exact identification
  of the character. The Canonical_Combining_Class and
  Decomposition_Mapping of a character are immutable, because of their
  importance to the stability of the Unicode Normalization Algorithm
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX15">UAX15</a>].</p>
  
  <p>The list of immutable character properties is shown in
  <i>Table 19</i>.</p>
  
  <p class="caption"><a name="Immutable_Properties_Table"></a>Table 19. Immutable Properties</p>
  <div align="center">

  <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Property Name</th>
        <th>Abbr Name</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>na</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Jamo_Short_Name</td>
        <td>jsn</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Canonical_Combining_Class</td>
        <td>ccc</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Decomposition_Mapping</td>
        <td>dm</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pattern_Syntax</td>
        <td>Pat_Syn</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pattern_White_Space</td>
        <td>Pat_WS</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
  
  <p>In some cases, a property is not immutable, but the list
  of possible values that it can have is considered
  invariant. For example, while at least some General_Category
  values are subject to change and correction, the enumerated set
  of possible values that the General_Category property can have
  is fixed and cannot be added to in the future.</p>

    <p>All characters other than 
    those of General_Category M* are guaranteed to have Canonical_Combining_Class=0.
    Currently it is also true that all characters
    other than those of General_Category Mn have Canonical_Combining_Class=0.
    However, the more constrained statement is not a guaranteed invariant;
    it is possible that some new character of
    General_Category Me or Mc could be given a non-zero value for
    Canonical_Combining_Class in the future.</p>

    <p>In Unicode 4.0 and thereafter, the General_Category value 
    <i>Decimal_Number</i> (Nd), and 
    the Numeric_Type value <i>Decimal</i> (de) are defined to be co-extensive; 
    that is, the set of 
    characters having General_Category=Nd will always be the same as the 
    set of characters having NumericType=de.</p>

  <h4>5.10.2 <a name="File_Invariants">UCD File Format Invariants</a></h4>
  
  <p>There are also some constraints on allowable change in the
  file formats for UCD files. In general, the 
  <a href="#Format_Conventions">file format conventions</a> are
  changed as little as possible, to minimize the impact on
  implementations which parse the machine-readable data files.
  However, some of the constraints on allowable file format
  change go beyond conservatism in format and instead have
  the status of invariants. These guarantees apply in particular
  to UnicodeData.txt, the very first data file associated with
  the UCD.</p>
  
  <p>The number and order of the fields in UnicodeData.txt is fixed.
     Any additional information about character properties to be added
     to the UCD in the future will 
     appear in separate data files, rather than being added as an 
     additional field to UnicodeData.txt or by reinterpretation
     of any of the existing fields.</p>
       
  <h4>5.10.3 <a name="Invariants_in_Implementations">Invariants in Implementations</a></h4>
  
  <p>Applications may wish to take the various character property
  and file format 
  invariants into account when choosing how to implement character properties.</p>
   
      <p>The Canonical_Combining_Class offers a good example. The
      character property invariants regarding Canonical_Combining_Class
      guarantee that values, once assigned, will never change, and
      that all values used will be in the range 0..255. This means
      that the Canonical_Combining_Class can be safely implemented
      in an unsigned byte and that any value stored in a table for
      an existing character will not need to be updated dynamically
      for a later version.</p>
      
      <p>In practice, for Canonical_Combining_Class far fewer 
      than 256 values are used. Unicode 3.0 used 53 values;
      Unicode 3.1 through Unicode 4.1 used 54 values; and Unicode 5.0
      through Unicode 5.1 used 55 values. New, non-zero
      Canonical_Combining_Class values are seldom added to the standard.
      (For details about this history, see 
      <a href="#DerivedCombiningClass.txt">DerivedCombiningClass.txt</a>.) 
      Implementations may take advantage of this fact for compression,
      because only the ordering of 
      the non-zero values, and not their absolute values, matters for 
      the Canonical Ordering Algorithm. In principle, it would be 
      possible for up to 256 values to be used in the future, but
      the chances of the actual number of values exceeding 128
      are remote at this point. There are implementation advantages 
      in restricting the number of internal class values to 
      128&#x2014;for example, the ability to use signed bytes without 
      implicit widening to ints in Java.</p>
  
<h3>5.11 <a name="Validation">Validation</a></h3>
  
  <p>The Unicode character
  property values in the UCD files can be validated by means of regular
  expressions. Such validation can also be useful in testing of
  implementations that return property values. The method of validation
  depends on the type of property, as described below.
  These expressions use Perl syntax, but may 
  of course be converted to other formal conventions for use 
  with other regular expression engines.</p>
  
  <p>The regular expressions which are appropriate for validation
  of particular properties may change in each subsequent version of the UCD.
  However, because of stability guarantees for character property aliases, these
  regular expressions for one version of
  the Unicode Standard will match valid values for previous versions
  of the standard.</p>
  	
  <h4>5.11.1 <a name="Validation_of_Enumerated">Enumerated and Binary Properties</a></h4>
  
  <p>Enumerated and binary character properties can be validated by
  generating a regular expression using the PropertyValueAliases.txt file. Because
  enumerated properties have a defined list of possible values, the validating
  regular expression simply ORs together all of the possible values. Binary properties
  are a special case of enumerated property, with a predefined very short
  list of possible values.</p>
  
  <p>For example, to validate the East_Asian_Width property in
  the UCD, or to test an implementation that returns the East_Asian_Width property,
  parse the following relevant lines from PropertyValueAliases.txt and produce a
  regular expression that concatenates each of the short and long property alias
  values.</p>

  <blockquote>  
  <pre>
# East_Asian_Width (ea)

ea ; A         ; Ambiguous
ea ; F         ; Fullwidth
ea ; H         ; Halfwidth
ea ; N         ; Neutral
ea ; Na        ; Narrow
ea ; W         ; Wide
  </pre>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The resulting regular expression would then be:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  <pre>
  /A|Ambiguous|F|Fullwidth|H|Halfwidth|N|Neutral|Na|Narrow|W|Wide/
  </pre>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>For each Unicode binary character property, the regular
  expression can be precomputed simply as:</p>
  
   <blockquote>
   <pre>
  /N|No|F|False|Y|Yes|T|True/
  </pre>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>The Catalog properties, Age, Block, and Script, are another
  type of enumerated character property. All possible values of those properties
  for any given version of the Unicode Standard are listed in PropertyValueAliases.txt,
  so a validating regular expression for a Catalog property for that given version of the UCD can be
  generated by concatenating values, as for the other enumerated properties.</p>
 
  <h4>5.11.2 <a name="Validation_of_CCC">Combining_Character_Class Property</a></h4>
  
  <p>The Combining_Character_Class (ccc) property is a hybrid type. The
  possible values defined for it in UnicodeData.txt range from 0 to 255 and are numeric
  values. However, Combining_Character_Class also has symbolic aliases defined for those particular values
  that are in actual use; those symbolic aliases are listed in PropertyValueAliases.txt.
  To produce a validating regular expression for Combining_Character_Class, concatenate
  together the symbolic aliases from PropertyValueAliases.txt, and then add the numeric
  range 0..255.</p>
  
  <h4>5.11.3 <a name="Validation_of_Unihan">Unihan Properties</a></h4>
  
  <p>The validating regular expressions for each property tag defined
  in the Unihan database are described in detail in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].</p>

  <h4>5.11.4 <a name="Validation_of_Other">Other Properties</a></h4>
  
  <p>Regular expressions to validate String and Miscellaneous properties
  in the UCD are provided in <i>Table 21</i>. Although Catalog properties may use
  strict tests, as described in  <i>Section 5.11.1 <a href="#Validation_of_Enumerated">Enumerated and Binary Properties</a></i>,
  generic patterns for Block
  and Script are also provided in <i>Table 21</i>.</p>
  
  <p>To simplify the
  presentation of these expressions, commonly occurring subexpressions are first
  abstracted out as variables defined in <i>Table 20</i>.</p>

<h3>5.12 <a name="Deprecation">Deprecation</a></h3>

<p>In the Unicode Standard, the term <i>deprecation</i> is used somewhat
differently than it is in some other standards. Deprecation is used to
mean that a character or other feature is strongly discouraged from use.
This should not, however, be taken as indicating that anything has been
removed from the standard, nor that anything is <i>planned</i> for removal
from the standard. Any such change is constrained by the
Unicode Consortium Stability Policies [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#Stability">Stability</a>].</p>

<p>For the Unicode Character Database, there are two important types
of deprecation to be noted. First, an <i>encoded character</i> may be
deprecated. Second, a <i>character property</i> may be deprecated.</p>

<p>When an encoded character is strongly discouraged from use, it is
given the property value Deprecated=True. The <a href="#Deprecated">Deprecated</a> property
is a binary property defined specifically to carry this information about
Unicode characters. Very few characters are ever formally
deprecated this way; it is not enough that a character be uncommon, obsolete,
disliked, or not preferred. Only those few characters which have been
determined by the UTC to have serious architectural defects or which
have been determined to cause significant implementation problems are
ever deprecated. Even in the most severe cases, such as the
deprecated format control characters (U+206A..U+206F), an encoded character
is <i>never</i> removed from the standard. Furthermore, although deprecated
characters are strongly discouraged from use, and should be avoided in
favor of other, more appropriate mechanisms, they <i>may</i> occur in data.
Conformant implementations of Unicode processes such a Unicode normalization <i>must</i>
handle even deprecated characters correctly.</p>

<p>In the Unicode Character Database, a character property may
also become strongly discouraged&#x2014;usually because it no longer
serves the purpose it was originally defined for. In such cases, the
property is labelled "deprecated" in 
<i>Table 9, <a href="#Property_List_Table">Property Table</a></i>.
For example, see the <a href="#Grapheme_Link">Grapheme_Link</a> property.</p>

<h2>6 <a name="Test_Files">Test Files</a></h2>

    <p>The normative status of these test files reflects their use to
    determine the correctness of implementations claiming conformance
    to the respective algorithms listed in the table. There is no
    requirement that any particular Unicode implementation also
    implement the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm, for example, but
    <i>if</i> it implements that algorithm correctly, it should be
    able to replicate the test case results specified in the
    data entries in LineBreakTest.txt.</p>

<h3>6.1 <a name="NormalizationTest_txt"> NormalizationTest.txt </a></h3> 

  <p>This file contains data which can be used to test an implementation of the 
  Unicode Normalization Algorithm. 
  (See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX15">UAX15</a>].)</p>
  
  <p>The data file has a Unicode string in the first field (which may consist
  of just a single code point). The next four fields then specify the expected
  output results of converting that string to Unicode Normalization Forms
  NFC, NFD, NFKC, and NFKD, respectively. There are many tricky edge cases
  included in the input data, to ensure that implementations have correctly
  implemented some of the more complex subtleties of the Unicode Normalization
  Algorithm.</p>
  
  <p>The header section of NormalizationTest.txt provides additional information
  regarding the normalization invariant relations that any conformant
  implementation should be able to replicate.</p>
  
  <p>The Unicode Normalization Algorithm is not tailorable. Conformant
  implementations should be expected to produce results as specified in
  NormalizationTest.txt and should not deviate from those results.</p> 

<h3>6.2 <a name="Segmentation_Test_Files">Segmentation Test Files and Documentation</a></h3>

<p>LineBreakTest.txt, located in the auxiliary directory of the UCD, 
contains data which can be used 
to test an implementation of the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm. 
(See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>].) The header of
that file specifies the data format and the use of the test data to
specify line break opportunities. Note that non-ASCII characters are used
in this test data as field delimiters.</p>
 
<p>There is an associated documentation file, LineBreakTest.html, which displays 
the results of the Line Breaking Algorithm in an interactive chart form, with a 
documented listing of the rules.</p>

  <p>The Unicode text segmentation test data files are also located in the 
  auxiliary directory of the UCD. They 
  contain data which can be used to test an implementation of the segmentation 
  algorithms specified in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-7.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>].
  The headers of
  those file specify the data format and the use of the test data to
  specify text segmentation opportunities. Note that non-ASCII characters are used
  in this test data as field delimiters.</p>
  
  <p>There are also associated documentation 
  files, which display the results of the segmentation algorithms in an 
  interactive chart form, with a documented listing of the rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GraphemeBreakTest.html </li>
    <li>SentenceBreakTest.html </li>
    <li>WordBreakTest.html </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Unlike the Unicode Normalization Algorithm, the Unicode Line Breaking
  Algorithm and the various text segmentation algorithms are tailorable,
  and there is every expectation that implementations will tailor these
  algorithms to produce results as needed. The test data files only test
  the <i>default</i> behavior of the algorithms. Testing of tailored implementations
  will need to modify and/or extend the test cases as appropriate to match
  any documented tailoring.</p>
  
<h3>6.3 <a name="BidiTest_txt"> BidiTest.txt </a></h3> 

  <p>This file contains data which can be used to test an implementation of the 
  Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.

  <p>The data in BidiTest.txt is intended to exhaustively test
  all possible combinations of Bidi_Class values for strings of length four or less.
  To allow for the resulting very large number of test cases,
  the data file has a somewhat complicated format which is
  described in the header. Fundamentally, for each input string and for each
  possible input paragraph level, the test data specifies the resulting bidi levels and
  expected reordering.</p>

  <p>The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm is tailorable within certain limits. 
  Conformant implementations with no tailoring are expected to produce the results as
  specified in BidiTest.txt and should not deviate from those results. Tailored
  implementations can also use the data in BidiTest.txt to test for overall conformance 
  to the algorithm by changing the assignment of properties to characters to reflect
  the details of their tailoring.</p>
